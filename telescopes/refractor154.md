This telescope is very much still in the works. The base design starts with a 154mm lens bought from ebay [here](https://www.ebay.com/itm/185482296603?_trkparms=amclksrc%3DITM%26aid%3D777008%26algo%3DPERSONAL.TOPIC%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D267533%26meid%3Dc32a6838a39b4d5797b2ae5e85400c38%26pid%3D101959%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D1%26itm%3D185482296603%26pmt%3D1%26noa%3D1%26pg%3D4375194%26algv%3DRecentlyViewedItemsV2Mobile%26brand%3DUnbranded&_trksid=p4375194.c101959.m146925&_trkparms=parentrq%3A47b112d01900ab9d6d5f087cfffe9888%7Cpageci%3A887dfff8-31c2-11ef-b59e-2229577eab01%7Ciid%3A1%7Cvlpname%3Avlp_homepage).

### Design and Build

The first step in the design, would be to sandwich the two pieces of glass together to form a single objective lens.

This is done with two separate 3D printed pieces. A heat set insert is used on the bottom piece, in every other hole, to hold the two halves together.

The remaining holes will be used with heat set inserts in the body of the telescope tube to hold the lens into its housing.
